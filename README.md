This is just a set of scripts to combine two weather pages on the webserver to one, so I can compare them.

This code can be found in the following places:
* https://wx1.slackology.net/plots/wx.html	<--page
* https://github.com/mcthoren/nw.wx		<--code
* https://wx1.slackology.net/			<--code, data, plots, page

Much of the data for all this is currently collected from a BME680, the datasheet for which can be found here:
